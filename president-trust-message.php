    <h2>Omkarananda Ashram President’s Message</h2>
    <p>Competition is the keyword for a successful manager in his work. Competition will make him work more hard. He will see how to improve himself; he will see how to improve the surrounding. A real manager is a man who listens, he is glad when people tell him the mistakes, he will not be disappointed even if he has been scolded, he will learn out of mistakes, he will brighten his experience, that is what is needed today. The ideal manager is supposed to have the psychological power to unite the forces which are under him in a way that they look upon him as the top guiding force, with whom they feel safe and sure for handling the difficulties in front of them.</p>
    <p>The greater the pain, the greater is the gain. The manager of today will have to take lot of burden on his shoulders. As a smart man he will not stop at 8-hours’ duty, there is no timing for him. Thomas Alva Edison, one of the biggest inventors ever, was sleeping only 5 hours. We know from Bill Gates, who is today running the world’s biggest software empire, that he is engaged even up to 20 hours a day. This is what makes a man a successful man, this means to do the maximum work in the minimum of time.</p>
    <p>We have in India managers who are shining of excellence. Let us take these people as an example before us. India is a place that has a huge capacity of intelligentsia and there is no doubt that a great and successful change will take place in India as well as outside of India.</p>
    <p>The excellent experienced and well trained Professors of our Institute will ensure the utmost progress for our dear students.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the gracious blessings of Paramahamsa Shri Swami Omkarananda, who could foresee the future, a beautiful place has been given to us to develop and to help our students to make them shiningly powerful and attractive administrators or managers. The spirit of Swamiji will protect each of our students, it will guide them, it will protect them and it will make their life better.</p>
